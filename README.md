## Wordpress Widget Manager
Simply a Wordpress plugin dedicated to help easily manage custom and default Wordpress widgets.
Lets be honest who really uses all of those default Wordpress widgets? Custom is the way to go in my opinions.
Well if they are going to be unused why leave them cluttering in wordpress widgets page. Simply turn them off and make room for your custom widgets is what this plugin goal is. to bridge the gap between custom widgets and wordpress while not disrupting a wordpress setup for them novices.   
## Features
* The ability to disable/enable any Default widgets.
